# Pitifall
This is the repo of the final project of HackUPC 2022. Presenting Pitifall, a simple web-app game inspired on our faculty's bar iconic sandwich: Pitiflí.
Pitiflí is a croquettes and cheese sandwich that was created years ago in Barcelona School of Informatic's bar (Bar de la FIB). Come and try Pitiflí and other famous sandwiches such as Bacon-Queso (bacon with cheese), Rebozado-Queso (fried chicken with cheese) or the newest release: Superpitiflí (Croquettes, cheese and bacon).
